# Contributing to Apache Iggy

## Issue First

Every new PR that introduces new functionality must link to an approved issue.
PRs without one may be closed at maintainer's discretion.

1. Create an issue or comment under existing
2. Wait for the issue to be assigned to you
    - Maintainer may request for more details or a different approach
3. Then code

## High-Risk Areas

These require design discussion in the issue before coding:

- Persistence (segments, indexes, state, crash recovery)
- Protocol (binary format, wire encoding)
- Concurrency (shards, inter-shard)
- Public API (HTTP, SDKs, CLI)
- Connectors

## PR Requirements

### Run It Locally

**If you can't run it, you can't submit it.**

Authors of PRs must run the code locally. "Relying on CI" is not acceptable.

### AI Assistance

You are responsible for the code you submit, even if a tool wrote it.

Using an AI assistant to help you code is fine. Submitting code you don't understand is
not. Before you open a PR you must be able to explain what every part of the change does
and why, answer review questions about it yourself, and defend the design without going
back to the tool for an answer. If you can't, the PR isn't ready.

While you're new to the project, please keep to **one open PR at a time**. Review takes
longer than writing, so a queue of changes from one contributor holds up everyone else's.

Maintainers may close a PR at first review if it reads as a relay between the reviewer and
a model, rather than a change the author understands and takes responsibility for. That is
a judgment about the submission, not about you, and it does not bar you from contributing
again if you come back with a change you can take responsibility for.

### Green CI

Maintainers will not start reviewing a PR while its CI is failing. Get the
pipeline green first - a red build, lint, or test means the PR is not ready
for review.

### Single Purpose

One PR = one thing. Bug fix, refactor, feature - separate PRs. Mixed PRs will be closed.

### Quality Checks

For Rust code:

```bash
cargo fmt --all
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
cargo build
cargo test
cargo machete
cargo sort --workspace
```

For other languages, check the README in `foreign/{language}/` (e.g., `foreign/go/`, `foreign/java/`).

### Typos Checks

We use [typos](https://github.com/crate-ci/typos):

```bash
cargo install typos-cli --locked
typos
typos --write-changes
```

If it's indeed not a typo, you can set an exception in `.typos.toml`.

### License Header Checks

We use [HawkEye](https://github.com/fast/hawkeye):

```bash
cargo install hawkeye --version "$(cat .github/config/hawkeye.version)" --locked
./scripts/ci/license-headers.sh --check
./scripts/ci/license-headers.sh --fix
```

### Pre-commit Hooks

We use [prek](https://github.com/j178/prek):

```bash
cargo install prek
prek install
```

The hooks require **bash >= 4.2** and refuse to run on anything older. Every current
Linux distribution already satisfies this.

#### macOS

macOS ships bash 3.2 and never updates it, so this is the one platform that needs a
step:

```bash
brew install bash
```

Homebrew's bash has to precede `/bin` on `PATH`, which is the default for a Homebrew
install but not guaranteed. Check with:

```bash
bash --version
```

Git GUIs launched from the Dock get a minimal `PATH` where `/bin` wins, so the hook can
still find bash 3.2 after the install. Committing from a terminal avoids this.

## Code Style

### Comments: WHY, Not WHAT

```rust
// Bad: Increment counter
counter += 1;

// Good: Offset by 1 because segment IDs are 1-indexed in the wire protocol
counter += 1;
```

Don't comment obvious code. Do explain non-obvious decisions, invariants, and constraints.

### Commit Messages

Format: `type(scope): subject`

**Good examples from this repo:**

```none
fix(server): prevent panic when segment rotates during async persistence
fix(server): chunk vectored writes to avoid exceeding IOV_MAX limit
feat(server): add SegmentedSlab collection
refactor(server): consolidate permissions into metadata crate
chore(integration): remove streaming tests superseded by API-level coverage
```

Keep subject under 72 chars. Use body for details if needed.

## PR Triage Commands

Move a PR around the review queue by posting a slash command on its own
line in a regular PR comment (not an inline review reply):

| Command                             | Who                                 | Effect                                                       |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `/ready`                            | author or maintainer                | mark `S-waiting-on-review`                                   |
| `/author`                           | maintainer or returning contributor | mark `S-waiting-on-author`                                   |
| `/request-review @user-or-team ...` | author or maintainer                | request review from the listed `@user` / `@org/team` handles |
| `/pin`                              | author or maintainer                | add `pinned`, exempting the PR from the stale bot            |
| `/unpin`                            | author or maintainer                | remove `pinned`                                              |

Some labels move on their own: opening or marking a non-draft PR ready sets
`S-waiting-on-review`; a "Request changes" review sets `S-waiting-on-author`;
closing or converting to draft clears both.

Commands take up to ~90s. A 👍 reaction means applied, 😕 means you lacked
permission; if neither shows up, check the `PR Triage Apply` run in the
Actions tab.

## Close Policy

PRs may be closed if:

- Maintainer feels like proxy between maintainer and LLM
- No approved issue or no approval from a maintainer
- Code not ran and tested locally
- Mixed purposes or purposes not clear
- Can't answer questions about the change
- Inactivity, see [Stale PRs](#stale-prs) below

Whoever closes leaves a comment saying why. If the thread holds a finding
that outlives the change, open an issue for it and link it from that
comment. The closed thread is the first place someone looks to find out
whether anything fell through.

### Stale PRs

A bot labels a PR `S-stale` after 7 days without activity and closes it 7
days after that. A push, comment, review, reopen, or ready-for-review
clears the label. Drafts and PRs labeled `pinned` are exempt. Issues are
never labeled or closed by it. A closed PR can be reopened.

//! Per-shard request dispatch: queue plumbing and the request funnel.
//!
//! The tree: [`session_ops`] (login/register/logout and their replica
//! forwards), [`partition`] (the partition data plane, both mesh ends),
//! [`reads`] (the non-replicated read router), [`submit`] (the shard-0
//! metadata-submit RPC), `authz` (the wire-path authorization gates),
//! `failure` (the wire failure channels and the one send exit for
//! host-built frames).
//!
//! Deliberate asymmetry (the two authz gates): replicated metadata ops are
//! authorized in-apply by the STM, in committed order on every replica;
//! partition and non-replicated ops never enter the metadata log, so `authz`
//! gates them pre-dispatch against this shard's applied permissioner. The
//! HTTP spine keeps its own equivalent gates (see `crate::http`) because its
//! error contract (404-before-403) is pinned client-visible behavior.

// finds the existing table entry, verifies the authenticated user owns it,
// and returns its epoch, so `bind_session` binds the new transport to the
// old entry with its watermark and reply ring intact. That IS the resume.
//
// An earlier revision instead rebound an *unbound* transport straight from
// the table whenever a replicated frame carried a matching
// `(client, session)`, treating that pair as a bearer token. That was wrong
// in four ways, and the combination was a pre-auth session takeover:
//
//   - it called `SessionManager::login` itself, so no credential was ever
//     presented, and the connection was logged in as the entry's cached
//     `user_id`; authority for replicated ops then resolves from the table
//     (`resolve_acting_user_id`) and for partition ops from the session
//     manager, so BOTH planes ran as the original registrant;
//   - the pair carries far less entropy than "client-generated random
//     u128" implies: HTTP mints `client_id` from the shard-0 sequential
//     counter (`mint_shard_zero_client_id`, seeded at 1 per process) and no
//     live path ever bumps an epoch past 1, so the token was `client=N,
//     session=1` for small N;
//   - `ClientEntry` carries no transport or plane tag, so a raw TCP peer
//     could bind an HTTP-originated session;
//   - `bind_session` demotes the evicted holder to `Connected`, the one
//     state `login` accepts, so the loser's next replicated frame
//     re-resumed and stole the session back, unbounded and with no eviction
//     frame either way.
//
// Routing resume through login also restores the checks that path owns:
// password / PAT verification, `UserStatus::Active`, PAT expiry, the
// protocol-version gate, and SDK-info recording.
//
// An unbound transport sending a replicated frame therefore gets the typed
// `Eviction(NoSession)` fail-fast below and must log in.

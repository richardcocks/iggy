/// Reads messages from the partitions of one topic and yields them one at a time.
///
/// A topic is split into partitions, and a partition is an ordered log that producers append to.
/// Every message sits at an *offset*, its position in that log. Reading is therefore always the
/// same three decisions: which partition to read, where in it to start, and how to keep track of
/// how far you got so the next run can continue there.
///
/// `IggyConsumer` handles all three. It fetches batches of messages from the server, keeps them in
/// an in-memory buffer, decrypts them when it has an encryptor, and records how far it has read.
/// **It implements [`Stream`], so consuming is a loop over [`StreamExt::next`].**
///
/// You can use a consumer as a worker draining a topic, a reader that replays a
/// partition from a chosen point, and a pool of consumers sharing a workload through a consumer
/// group.
///
/// # Creating a consumer
///
/// Easiest way is to use the [`IggyClient`] with a configured connection. Then:
/// - [`IggyClient::consumer()`] builds a standalone consumer, bound to the one partition passed
///   in.
/// - [`IggyClient::consumer_group()`] builds a member of a consumer group. The server gives every
///   partition to exactly one member, so several consumers using the same group name split the
///   topic between them and share one set of offsets.
///
/// Note, building never talks to the server. [`init()`](Self::init) must be awaited once before the
/// first message is read.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// A standalone consumer reading partition 1 with the defaults:
///
/// ```rust,no_run
/// use futures_util::StreamExt;
/// use iggy::prelude::*;
///
/// # async fn example() -> Result<(), IggyError> {

///
/// let mut consumer = client
///     .consumer("my-consumer", "my-stream", "my-topic", 1)?
///     .batch_length(100)
///     .poll_interval(IggyDuration::new_from_secs(1))
///     .build();
/// consumer.init().await?;
///
/// while let Some(received) = consumer.next().await {
///     match received {
///         Ok(received) => println!("Offset: {}", received.message.header.offset),

///
/// # Which partitions are read
///
/// A **standalone consumer** reads exactly one partition, the one passed to
/// [`IggyClient::consumer()`]. Covering a whole topic with several partitions
/// means running one consumer per partition and dividing the work yourself.
///
/// A **consumer group member** does not choose. The server hands every partition of the topic to
/// exactly one member, so consumers sharing a group name split the topic between them without
/// coordinating. [`ReceivedMessage::partition_id`] tells where a message came from.
///
/// What to know when working with consumer groups:
/// - With [`auto_join_consumer_group()`] (the default) a member joins during [`init()`](Self::init),
///   creating the group first if [`create_consumer_group_if_not_exists()`] is set (the default).
///   It rejoins on its own after a reconnect and whenever the server reports that its membership
///   is gone.
/// - Such a member does not poll until it is in the group. A join that fails is yielded as
///   `Some(Err(..))` after [`polling_retry_interval()`], and the next call tries again.
/// - Partitions are redistributed whenever members join or leave, so a member reads different
///   partitions over time and messages from several partitions interleave in its stream.
/// - More members than partitions leaves the surplus members without partitions. Such a member
///   keeps asking the server for an assignment, parking for [`polling_retry_interval()`] between
///   attempts. The partition count of the topic is the ceiling on how far one group can be
///   scaled out.
/// - The group shares one set of stored offsets, kept under the group name. Thus,
///   a partition taken over by another member continues where the previous one
///   committed.
///
/// # How messages are read
///
/// Reading is done by polling. One request fetches up to [`batch_length()`] messages. The consumer
/// passes the first one to the caller and buffers the rest. The next request is sent once that buffer
/// is empty.
///
/// [`poll_interval()`] sets the smallest gap between two requests, measured from one send to the
/// next. Without it the next request goes out as soon as the previous one is answered, which is
/// the fastest option but keeps a busy loop running against an idle topic.
///
/// [`polling_strategy()`] decides **where** in the partition reading begins:
///
/// | Strategy | Starts at |
/// | --- | --- |
/// | [`PollingStrategy::next()`] (default) | the message after the offset stored on the server, or the first message when nothing is stored yet |
/// | [`PollingStrategy::first()`] | the oldest message in the partition |
/// | [`PollingStrategy::last()`] | the end of the partition (returns up to [`batch_length()`] of the most recent messages) |
/// | [`PollingStrategy::offset()`] | a custom offset |
/// | [`PollingStrategy::timestamp()`] | the first message at or after a given point in time |
///
/// Only [`PollingStrategy::next()`] consults the offset stored on the server.
/// Use this if you want to resume where a previous run stopped. The other four are the starting
/// point for the first request to each partition. From then on the consumer asks that partition
/// for whatever follows the last message it handed over from it, and it keeps that position per
/// partition. A partition that moves to another member and back therefore continues from this
/// consumer's own position, not from where the other member got to, so a rebalance can repeat
/// messages under these strategies, which ignore the group's stored offsets by definition.
///
/// [`StreamExt::next`] yields `None` once [`shutdown()`](Self::shutdown) has been called, and never
/// otherwise: not when the topic is empty and not while the client is disconnected. A request that
/// comes back empty is not an error and not the end of the stream, it just means nothing new has
/// arrived yet.
///
/// A failed poll request waits [`polling_retry_interval()`] before yielding `Some(Err(..))` and leaves
/// the consumer usable for the next call. This delay also applies to terminal server errors and when
/// the ordinary poll interval is disabled. Connection and authentication failures are yielded at once
/// and pause polling until the client has reconnected and signed in again, which the consumer handles
/// automatically; the next call parks for [`polling_retry_interval()`] while polling is paused. Hence,
/// deciding when to give up on repeated errors is up to you.
///
/// For a boilerplate implementation of such a loop Iggy provides [`IggyConsumerMessageExt::consume_messages`].
///
/// # Tracking what has been read
///
/// An offset is the index tracking what has been already read from a partition by the consumer.
/// Managing the offset has implications on where consumers resume reading messages.
///
/// There are two positions (offsets) tracked in two different places:
/// - The **reading position** is held by the consumer, one per partition, and is the offset of the
///   last message handed over
///   ([`get_last_consumed_offset()`](Self::get_last_consumed_offset)). It dies with the process.
/// - The **stored offset** lives on the server under the consumer name, or the group name for a
///   group. This offset survives restarts. Writing it is called *storing* or *committing* an offset.
///
/// Committing matters because [`PollingStrategy::next()`] resumes from the stored offset. A
/// consumer that never commits starts over from the same place on every run. Within a run it
/// stalls instead: the server serves the same messages again on every request, messages at or
/// below the reading position are dropped (see [Guarantees](#guarantees)), so the stream goes
/// quiet once the reading position is [`batch_length()`] or more ahead of the stored offset. Under
/// [`PollingStrategy::next()`], keep commits within [`batch_length()`] of the reading position.
///
/// [`auto_commit()`] decides when the consumer commits by itself:
///
/// | Setting | Commits |
/// | --- | --- |
/// | [`AutoCommit::Disabled`] | never, not even on [`shutdown()`](Self::shutdown). Commit with [`store_offset()`](Self::store_offset) |
/// | [`AutoCommit::Interval`] | on every tick, the reading position of every partition read so far |
/// | [`AutoCommitWhen::PollingMessages`] | sends the commit with the poll request itself, before your code sees the batch |
/// | [`AutoCommitWhen::ConsumingEachMessage`] | queued just before every message is handed over to the calling code. Commits queued faster than they are sent collapse into the latest one per partition |
/// | [`AutoCommitWhen::ConsumingEveryNthMessage`] | queued just before a message whose offset divides by `n` is handed over |
/// | [`AutoCommitWhen::ConsumingAllMessages`] | queued when the buffer of the current batch runs empty |
/// | [`AutoCommitAfter`] variants | once the handler returned, `Ok` or `Err`, and only under [`IggyConsumerMessageExt::consume_messages`], see below |
///
/// [`AutoCommit::IntervalOrWhen`] and [`AutoCommit::IntervalOrAfter`] combine an interval with a
/// message trigger. The default is [`AutoCommit::IntervalOrWhen`] with one second and
/// [`AutoCommitWhen::PollingMessages`].
/// Important implications of these settings:
/// - [`AutoCommitWhen::PollingMessages`] marks a batch as consumed while it is being delivered,
///   before your code has seen any of it. For a crash-safe option configure with [`AutoCommit::Disabled`]
///   and manually store the offset with [`Self::store_offset()`].
/// - [`AutoCommitWhen::ConsumingEveryNthMessage`] tests the offset of a message, not a counter of
///   messages this process handled, so it commits at every `n`-th offset of the partition. With
///   `n = 0` the trigger never fires, so without an interval only [`shutdown()`](Self::shutdown)
///   commits.
/// - [`AutoCommitAfter::ConsumingAllMessages`] fires for the message whose offset equals the
///   partition head seen by the poll ([`ReceivedMessage::current_offset`]), not when the buffer
///   runs empty, so a consumer that lags behind commits nothing until it has caught up. Every
///   [`AutoCommitAfter`] variant commits after a handler that returned `Err` as well.
///
/// ## Guarantees
///
/// - **Each message is handed over once per consumer.** Messages whose offset is not greater than
///   the reading position of their partition are dropped before they reach the stream. Re-reading
///   a partition, or seeing a failed message again within the same consumer, needs
///   [`allow_replay()`], which turns that filter off. A new consumer starts with an empty filter.
/// - **Delivering at-least-once.** If you cannot tolerate missing any messages, use [`AutoCommit::Disabled`]
///   and store the offset using [`Self::store_offset()`] after handling a message. Every other
///   setting except the plain [`AutoCommit::After`] variants can commit a message before your
///   handler is done with it, so a crash in the handler loses it. [`AutoCommit::IntervalOrAfter`]
///   still commits on its interval tick, and [`shutdown()`](Self::shutdown) commits the reading
///   position under every setting but [`AutoCommit::Disabled`], a failed message included.
///
/// # Options and defaults
///
/// Everything is configured on the [`IggyConsumerBuilder`] before [`build()`] and is fixed
/// afterwards.
///
/// | Option | Default | Controls |
/// | --- | --- | --- |
/// | [`stream()`], [`topic()`], [`partition()`] | the values passed to the entry point | what is read. [`partition()`] is for standalone consumers, a group member ignores it with a warning and reads the server's assignment |
/// | [`batch_length()`] | 1000 | messages fetched per request |
/// | [`poll_interval()`] | none | smallest gap between two requests |
/// | [`polling_strategy()`] | [`PollingStrategy::next()`] | where reading each partition starts |
/// | [`auto_commit()`] | [`AutoCommit::IntervalOrWhen`], one second, [`AutoCommitWhen::PollingMessages`] | when offsets are committed |
/// | [`allow_replay()`] | off | whether a message can be handed over again |
/// | [`auto_join_consumer_group()`] | on | joining the group during [`init()`](Self::init) and again whenever the membership is lost. With [`do_not_auto_join_consumer_group()`] joining is up to the caller, and a poll without a membership fails with [`IggyError::ConsumerGroupMemberNotFound`] |
/// | [`create_consumer_group_if_not_exists()`] | on | creating the group when it is missing |
/// | [`polling_retry_interval()`] | one second | delay before yielding poll errors other than connection and authentication failures, and between attempts while polling is blocked or the member holds no partitions |
/// | [`init_retries()`] | none, one second apart | retries when the stream or topic is missing at [`init()`](Self::init) |
/// | [`offset_drain_timeout()`] | five seconds | how long [`shutdown()`](Self::shutdown) waits for pending commits |
/// | [`encryptor()`] | inherited from the client | decrypting payloads and user headers, see [Encryption](#encryption) |
///
/// The switches have inverse setters as well, such as [`without_poll_interval()`],
/// [`without_encryptor()`], [`do_not_auto_join_consumer_group()`] and
/// [`do_not_create_consumer_group_if_not_exists()`].
///
/// # Encryption
///
/// A consumer with an encryptor, inherited from the [`IggyClient`] or set with [`encryptor()`],
/// decrypts payloads and user headers before a message is yielded. That only works if the producer
/// encrypted them with the same key, which an [`IggyProducer`] and an `IggyConsumer` from the same
/// client share unless one of them overrides it on its builder. Without an encryptor the consumer
/// yields payloads as stored, encrypted or not.
///
/// A message that cannot be decrypted is yielded as an `Err` and the whole batch is dropped. The
/// next request fetches the same batch and fails the same way until
/// [`store_offset()`](Self::store_offset) moves the offset past it. Under
/// [`AutoCommitWhen::PollingMessages`] the server would have committed the batch with the poll and
/// skipped it for good, so [`init()`](Self::init) rejects that setting, the default included, with
/// [`IggyError::InvalidConfiguration`] when the consumer has an encryptor.
///
/// # Concurrency
///
/// `IggyConsumer` is `Send` and `Sync` but not `Clone`. Driving the stream
/// ([`StreamExt::next`]) and [`shutdown()`](Self::shutdown) take `&mut self`, so one task owns and
/// drives a consumer end to end. To read offsets or commit from another task, take an
/// [`IggyConsumerState`] via [`state()`](Self::state): it is a cheap clone of the shared
/// bookkeeping and needs no lock.
///
/// Besides the stream, a consumer runs background tasks: one watching the connection lifecycle,
/// one sending queued commits, and an interval commit task for the [`AutoCommit`] variants that
/// carry an interval. See [`init()`](Self::init).
///
/// # Shutting down
///
/// Call [`shutdown()`](Self::shutdown) once done consuming. It drains the commit tasks, commits
/// the reading position of every partition unless [`auto_commit()`] is [`AutoCommit::Disabled`],
/// leaves the consumer group and stops the background tasks. Dropping an `IggyConsumer` instead
/// skips the final commit and the group leave, so the server reassigns the member's partitions
/// only once the connection is gone. Commits already queued are still sent and the background
/// tasks still stop.
